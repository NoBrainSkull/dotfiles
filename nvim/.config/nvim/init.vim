" This is my personal Nvim configuration supporting Mac, Linux and Windows, with various plugins configured.
" This configuration evolves as I learn more about Nvim and become more proficient in using Nvim.
" Since it is very long (more than 1000 lines!), you should read it carefully and take only the settings that suit you.
" I would not recommend cloning this repo and replace your own config. Good configurations are personal,
" built over time with a lot of polish.
